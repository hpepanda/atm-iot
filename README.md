# ATM IoT System
IoT this is a hardware and software system that consists of Raspberry Pi with a set of sensors (ultrasonic, acoustic, accelerometer, RaspiCam and ordinary web-camera) connected to it and bunch of servers built on the microservice architecture which work close to each other for processing the data received from the sensors.

The software needed for building of Iot server can be found in this repository. All types of servers distributed through the different branches, so, for installing a specific server in generally you need to:
+ Clone the current repository to your server instance:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hpepanda/atm-iot.git && cd atm-iot
    ```
+ Switch the branch from master to the other branch depending what server you need:

    ```
    git checkout <server_name>
    ```
